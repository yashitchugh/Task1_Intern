# Data Preprocessing and Cleaning Pipeline

This repository contains a step-by-step notebook for preprocessing and cleaning a dataset before performing any analysis or modeling. Below is an overview of the process followed in this project.

## üîπ Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Import and Explore the Dataset
- The dataset is first imported using `pandas`.
- Basic information such as data types, column names, and summary statistics are explored using `.info()` and `.describe()` to get a sense of the structure and content of the data.

### 2. Visualize Missing Values
- We use `seaborn.heatmap()` to visualize the locations of missing values in the dataset.
- This helps quickly identify which columns need to be cleaned or imputed.

### 3. Encode Categorical Features
- Categorical variables are converted into numerical values using **Label Encoding**.
- We use `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing`:
  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
  le = LabelEncoder()
  df['categorical_column'] = le.fit_transform(df['categorical_column'])


### 4. Standardize Numerical Features

* Numerical features are standardized using **Z-score scaling** to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
* This step is essential for many machine learning algorithms to perform optimally.

### 5. Visualize and Remove Outliers

* Boxplots are used to visualize outliers in each numerical column.
* Outliers are identified and removed to ensure the data is clean and to improve model performance.
